# Release Notes

A Forgejo release is published shortly after a Gitea release is published and they have [matching release numbers](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/src/branch/forgejo/CONTRIBUTING/RELEASE.md#release-numbering). Additional Forgejo releases may be published to address urgent security issues or bug fixes. Forgejo release notes include all Gitea release notes.

The Forgejo admin should carefully read the required manual actions before upgrading. A point release (e.g. v1.18.1 or v1.18.2) does not require manual actions but others might (e.g. v1.18.0, v1.19.0).

## 1.18.0-rc1-2

This is the first Forgejo release candidate.
